/* Os_api_simtimer.h - Simulated hardware timer driver, API
 *
 * This file is a header file for the simulated hardware timer driver.
 * The simulator implements two (or more) free-running timers in software. Each timer has
 * two (or more) compare registers that can be programmed to generate an "interrupt"
 * whenever the timer passes the value in the compare register.
 *
 * The difference between this timer and a real hardware timer is that the timer does not
 * automatically advance. It is advanced by calling the OS_SimTimerAdvance() function from a
 * (trusted) task, ISR etc. Thus the timer can be controlled precisely by the test program,
 * permitting fine-grained control over the "timing" and therefore accurate testing
 * of the software that uses it. It is especiall useful for testing the synchronisation
 * features.
 *
 * In addition to the 4 standard init/read/start/stop functions provided by this driver,
 * two additional functions are provided:
 *
 *  - OS_SimTimerSetup(tmr, mask, isr) sets up the timer.
 *  - OS_SimTimerAdvance(tmr, incr) advances the timer by incr ticks.
