/** \brief Appends the character 'U' to \a x to mark it as \e unsigned.
 *
 * This macro allows to use the same definition of a constant number in C
 * and assembler code.
 * Some assemblers don't like the 'U' suffix and cease to work.
 * The 'U', though, is important to suppress MISRA warnings.
 * This macro removes the 'U', when the code is prepared (preprocessed) for an assembler
 * and preserves it for a C compiler. This decision is based on the macro OS_ASM.
 *
 * \param x  A constant number.
